# Mixed-Effect Models

<br>

In this section I will describe the reasons why we use mixed-effect models, and how to apply such models to our type of data.  Until I find time to write that tutorial, I would recommend this [really good tutorial](https://gkhajduk.github.io/2017-03-09-mixed-models/) that introduces mixed-effect models.
